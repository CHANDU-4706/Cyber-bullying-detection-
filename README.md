# 🛡️ Cyberbullying Detection using NLP

This project is a machine learning-based approach to detect **cyberbullying** in online content using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. With the rise of social media, cyberbullying has become a critical issue, and this solution aims to automatically classify harmful text to promote safer digital interactions.

## 📌 Objective

The primary goal is to build a model that can classify user comments or messages as *bullying* or *non-bullying*. By applying NLP techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms, the project helps identify and mitigate the spread of online abuse.

## 📂 Project Highlights

- ✅ Clean and preprocess text data using NLP techniques  
- 🧠 Convert text to numerical format using Bag of Words (BoW)  
- 📊 Train/test split for performance evaluation  
- 🔍 Classification using machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**  
- 📈 Evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and other metrics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (optional, for visualization)

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing text
   - Removing punctuation and stopwords
   - Tokenization and optional lemmatization

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) for text vectorization

3. **Model Development**
   - Train/test split using `train_test_split`
   - Training with classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, recall, and F1-score (if implemented)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains social media comments labeled as:
- `0` → Non-bullying  
- `1` → Bullying  

*(Data set from kaggle website.)*

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Integrate **TF-IDF** and **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec)**  
- Apply **Deep Learning (LSTM, BERT)** for better context understanding  
- Build a real-time dashboard or web interface  
- Support for multiple languages
